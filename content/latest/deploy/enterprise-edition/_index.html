YugaByte DB Enterprise Edition is best fit for mission-critical deployments such as production or pre-production test. It starts out by first installing YugaWare, the YugaByte Admin Console, in a highly available mode and then spinning up YugaByte clusters on one or more datacenters (across public cloud and private on-premises datacenters).

YugaWare, the YugaByte Admin Console, is a containerized application that is installed and managed via [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) for mission-critical environments (such as production or performance or failure mode testing). Replicated is a purpose-built tool for on-premises deployment and lifecycle management of containerized applications. For environments that are not mission-critical such as those needed for local development or simple functional testing, you can also use the [Community Edition](/quick-start/install).
