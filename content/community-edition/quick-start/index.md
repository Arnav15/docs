 The easiest way to get started with the YugaByte Community Edition is to create a multi-node **local cluster** on your laptop or desktop. There are two options available.

  Local Cluster - Binary
</a>

<a class="section-link" href="/community-edition/quick-start/docker">
  Local Cluster - Docker
 </a>


{{< note title="Note" >}}
Running local clusters is not recommended for production environments. You can either deploy the [Community Edition] (/community-edition/deploy/) manually on a set of instances or use the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise-edition/deploy/) that automates all day-to-day operations including cluster administration across all major public clouds as well as on-premises datacenters.
