 The easiest way to get started with the YugaByte DB is to create a multi-node local cluster on your laptop or desktop.

</a>

  	2. Create Local Cluster

</a>

{{< note title="Note" >}}
Running local clusters is not recommended for production environments. You can either deploy the [Community Edition] (/community-edition/deploy/) manually on a set of instances or use the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise-edition/deploy/) that automates all day-to-day operations including cluster administration across all major public clouds as well as on-premises datacenters.
