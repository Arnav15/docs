YugaByte Community Edition is best for individual users looking to develop apps with YugaByte or learn how YugaByte works in detail. There are two options to get started.

## Local node

The [local node](./local-node/) option is best for a developer needing a local YugaByte API endpoint to develop application clients.

## Local cluster

The [local cluster](./local-cluster/) option is best for a developer or operations engineer needing to learn YugaByte in detail using a local 3-node cluster.
